        <p> In school, I got lost in a maze during a trip, turning it into a memorable adventure. 
            Camping involved questionable cooking skills and endless laughter. Bus rides were filled with spontaneous sing-alongs, creating lasting memories. 
            High school saw me stealing the show at a talent contest and organizing a successful charity event. Our class's tradition of themed costumes made the last day unforgettable. 
            University life brought impromptu adventures as I joined a club on a whim. Quirky professors and shared potluck dinners during late-night study sessions added unique touches to my academic journey.</p>

            <p>I have a heart that overflows with kindness,always caring deeply for those around me.abd always like to make new friends but sometimes new friends too much
                trouble because they think  that we have all time to spend with them.And all the time I like to help others if they ignore me.Sometime I think that is not 
                suitable to treate them.But I can not ignore them.I like to tell .</p>
